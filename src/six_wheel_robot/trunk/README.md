# Software architecture
## Architecture with node.js
This is the planned architecture.
However, there was a problem with Socket.IO in C++ so the next simple architecture was used.

## Architecture without node.js
Since there was a problem, C++ process directly sends serial command to Arduino.
The disadvantage of this system is that we can't control the robot remotely.
